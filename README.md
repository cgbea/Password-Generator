# Password-Generator

## Description

This project's goal was to complete starter code to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. The employee can specify the character count, as well as whether lowercase, uppercase, special characters and/or numbers are included, by clicking the 'Generate Password' button and answering the prompts.
